### Teaching Philosophy  

My method of teaching can be characterized by helping students build confidence through what they are learning, progressively challenging them with new concepts and confronting them with appropriately difficult problems toward the end of the teaching process. My primary function in this demanding process is to initiate students into knowledge building and guide their exploration of new information from which they can expand their existing learning capacity. Ultimately, I aim to create an engaging and active learning environment in which they can develop mental toughness, critical thinking skills and disciplined perspectives on real life.

### Continuum  

I consider mastering a profession as a continuum, not a series of schooling experiences that terminate after completing a vocational school or college program. Thus, I promote life-long learning by attempting to transition my students from their time with me to their next learning endeavor. Ingrained in my courses are the elements of self-directed and web-based learning, both of which I hope will help my students construct their own learning paths.

### Technology Integration

Technology is a key element of my teaching approach, not as a replacement for sound pedagogy but as a tool to enhance it. I use learning management systems, simulations, and engineering software to support diverse learning needs and increase engagement. My experience with online and hybrid delivery has underscored the importance of clarity and structure. I also emphasize digital literacy to prepare students for the thoughtful and effective use of technology in their professional lives.
